Tim Ferris puts out a weekly email called [5-bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday/) where he discusses the 5 things he's "been loving, using, and reading."

Honestly.. I don't find his things overly helpful or interesting - so I unsubscribed. BUT -  I liked the idea of keeping track of things that caught my eye throughout the week.

So here are some things that I watched, read, listened to, or otherwise enjoyed this week that I noticed enough to jot down.

## Watching

### **Netflix's The Punisher Season 2**

Overall really well done season. I also just learned that Netflix doesn't have an overly intuitive way to share a link directly to their content, so you'll have to search it.

## Reading

### **Parables of Judgement -  Robert Farrar Capon**

[Stan Lemon](https://stanlemon.net) sent me this book and I'm finally finishing the third book in the volume on the Parables of Judgement. I have really been enjoying his treatment of the parables.

## Listening

### **Life with a Twist of Lemon**

This week we had an episode on the Super Bowl, Weezer, and National Pizza Day. If you haven't listened to the podcast you should!

Stopped by to have lunch with Friends here today. Their Duck and Cover brew was delightful.
