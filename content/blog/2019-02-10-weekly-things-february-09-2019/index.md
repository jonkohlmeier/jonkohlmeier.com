Tim Ferris puts out a weekly email called [5-bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday/) where he discusses the 5 things he's "been loving, using, and reading."

Honestly.. I don't find his things overly helpful or interesting - so I unsubscribed. BUT -  I liked the idea of keeping track of things that caught my eye throughout the week.

So here are some things that I watched, read, listened to, or otherwise enjoyed this week that I noticed enough to jot down.



## Watching

### **Netflix's The Punisher Season 2**

Overall really well done season. I also just learned that Netflix doesn't have an overly intuitive way to share a link directly to their content, so you'll have to search it.



## Reading

### **Parables of Judgement -  Robert Farrar Capon**

[Stan Lemon](https://stanlemon.net) sent me this book and I'm finally finishing the third book in the volume on the Parables of Judgement. I have really been enjoying his treatment of the parables.

## Listening

### **Life with a Twist of Lemon**

This week we had an episode on the Super Bowl, Weezer, and National Pizza Day. If you haven't listened to the podcast you should!

## Consuming

### **Roasters Coffee House - Ethiopian Yirgacheffe**

If you're in the Cedar Rapids area stop by Roasters to stock up on beans or to sit and enjoy a cup!

### **Big Grove Brew Pub**

Stopped by to have lunch with Friends here today. Their Duck and Cover brew was delightful.

2 oz gin (I use Beefeater.) 3-5 dashes Angostura Bitters Optional garnish: lemon twist
