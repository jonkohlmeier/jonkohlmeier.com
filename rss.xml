This wasn’t the first website that I ever built, but it was the first one that would be the internet home for an organization. (In this case, my church).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the year that I wasn’t in school after failing out of my first year of college the previous spring. You could say this served as a self-assigned “final project.” By no means was this A+ work - I’m no designer after all. But I learned a lot and discovered the immense value of iterative improvements. I also learned that you don’t need to be a philosopher to logically solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year I also took on more responsibilities as content manager and webmaster for the organization I was working part time for. That led to falling in love with all things web and I was hungry to learn more. I learned that I was good at solving problems quickly and was able to provide excellent customer support. I was also extremely lucky to have a genius developer who took me under his wing and has been my mentor ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I ended up enrolling in an IT: Networking program the following year. I knew I loved technology, but the math requirements scared me away from many of the CS and web specific programs. IT: Networking exposed me to other aspects of technology and security that still serve me well today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first full-time gig found me in a “swiss army knife roll” - part system admin, part webmaster, part editor, part event planner and part accountant, but the itch for all things internet was still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to last week and the company at which I serve as the Director of Web Development launched four newly designed websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advice from the things I’ve learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that my advice is worth anything, but if I were to share some of the things I’ve learned over the last 11 years it would be these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t do something just because it’s what you think is expected of you or because it’s what everyone else seems to be doing. I enrolled at an expensive college and had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do. (Bonus tip: don’t take Koine Greek for a grade.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t remain idle. Don’t remain stagnant. Push to learn and grow - even in the times when you feel worthless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s okay to fail. Learn something from it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’re not as important as you think you are. There are others in your life that are more important than you, serve them. This is also freeing in allowing you to try something even if you might fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally there are 3 specific people I’d like to thank for their impact on this journey of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks Pastor Koch for letting me ship my first website into production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://stanlemon.net&quot;&gt;Stan Lemon&lt;/a&gt; for continuing to answer any and all questions not only development and career related but also in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcnarymarketing.com&quot;&gt;Josh McNary&lt;/a&gt; for bringing me onto the team and helping scratch the itch by dabbling in all things internet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weekly Things - February 09, 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[Tim Ferris puts out a weekly email called 5-bullet Friday where he discusses the 5 things he’s “been loving, using, and reading.” Honestly…]]></description><link>https://jonkohlmeier.com/2019-02-10-weekly-things-february-09-2019/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jonkohlmeier.com/2019-02-10-weekly-things-february-09-2019/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tim Ferris puts out a weekly email called &lt;a href=&quot;https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday/&quot;&gt;5-bullet Friday&lt;/a&gt; where he discusses the 5 things he’s “been loving, using, and reading.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly.. I don’t find his things overly helpful or interesting - so I unsubscribed. BUT -  I liked the idea of keeping track of things that caught my eye throughout the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here are some things that I watched, read, listened to, or otherwise enjoyed this week that I noticed enough to jot down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Watching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netflix’s The Punisher Season 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall really well done season. I also just learned that Netflix doesn’t have an overly intuitive way to share a link directly to their content, so you’ll have to search it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parables of Judgement -  Robert Farrar Capon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stanlemon.net&quot;&gt;Stan Lemon&lt;/a&gt; sent me this book and I’m finally finishing the third book in the volume on the Parables of Judgement. I have really been enjoying his treatment of the parables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GzFwLl&quot;&gt;Get it on Amazon.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Listening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life with a Twist of Lemon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we had an episode on the Super Bowl, Weezer, and National Pizza Day. If you haven’t listened to the podcast you should!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Art of Manliness Podcast #470 - A Proven System for Building and Breaking Habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Grove Brew Pub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped by to have lunch with Friends here today. Their Duck and Cover brew was delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://biggrovebrewery.com&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

I remember briefly thinking about…]]></description><link>https://jonkohlmeier.com/2018-03-28-core-values/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jonkohlmeier.com/2018-03-28-core-values/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2018 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.artofmanliness.com/2009/05/31/30-days-to-a-better-man-day-1-define-your-core-values/&quot;&gt;The Art of Manliness (AoM) post on defining core values&lt;/a&gt; several years ago. I remember briefly thinking about some of the things I value — but I don’t remember ever formally discovering/defining “core values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few weeks ago and I got started thinking about these things as I was debating what the next iteration of &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonkohlmeiertest.local/&quot;&gt;jonkohlmeiertest.local&lt;/a&gt; looks like. Originally I set up the website when I started venturing in the digital marketing/web development world. That venture was short-lived because I was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcnarymarketing.com/2017/03/welcome-jon-kohlmeier-webdev-operations-manager/&quot;&gt;offered the opportunity to do those sorts of things full-time&lt;/a&gt; rather than while burning the midnight oil. A year later &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonkohlmeiertest.local/&quot;&gt;jonkohlmeiertest.local&lt;/a&gt; sits abandoned — much the same as when I first built it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what to do? My first thought was to use it as a marketing playground for myself — to begin to build a personal brand. Naturally, as with all new ventures, the first step is to Google a question. In this case: “&lt;a href=&quot;http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+do+I+build+my+personal+brand%3F&quot;&gt;How do I build my personal brand?&lt;/a&gt;” Predictably, Google bombarded me with millions of results, I picked a dozen or so to read, and about 5% of the information I gathered was worth the time it took to trudge through. But something brought my mind back to The Art of Manliness post. How can you set up a personal brand without knowing what you value?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovering Core Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step I took was to brain dump things that came to mind immediately. I then asked those close to me what they perceived as my core values — of course I must value something — those who interact with me regularly probably have a pretty good idea of what those values are. People I asked included my wife, father in law, good friends, and my current and former managers. Thankfully they came back with a lot of things that were similar to the ones that I had already written down. (I’m not delusional! … at least in this case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some answers I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brevity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Punctuality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclecticism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spontaneity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellence - ”&lt;em&gt;which is a way of saying you’re impatient around stupid people&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Committed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trustworthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pizza.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honesty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard Work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faithfullness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Committed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wisdom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friendship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Beauty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Financial stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-reliance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defining CORE Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there I narrowed down to a Top 5. Harder than it looks, but I thought about what I really did value as a person and started prioritizing from there. I ended up with these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friendship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Reliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faith&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith naturally rose to the top of the list. This frames everything else down the list (and beyond). My identity is found first and foremost in being a baptized child of God - baptized into the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of my sins — and the sins of the world.  Everything flows from that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first course of study in college was Philosophy based on interests in Christian thought and Christian apologetics. I passionately served as a participant, then volunteer, then employee with &lt;a href=&quot;http://higherthings.org&quot;&gt;a Lutheran youth organization&lt;/a&gt; for 12 years. It’s through that same organization that I met my lovely wife. My first full time job was at a district office of &lt;a href=&quot;http://lcms.org&quot;&gt;The Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod&lt;/a&gt;. I’m still heavily involved in church at the congregation, district, and synod levels. My faith — specifically the Lutheran faith as found in the Scriptures and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bookofconcord.org&quot;&gt;Book of Concord&lt;/a&gt; - is the lens through which I see everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cliche? Maybe. But it’s the best word I found to capture many of the ideas that came up in the discovery phase: truth, committed, honest, hard working, etc. Not only do I value these things in myself, but I value them in those around me. I gravitate toward those who have a strong sense of integrity — of being honest and whole in the things that they pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friendship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friendship revealed itself as a core value based on AoM’s prompting to “Think of a time when you were happiest.” Immediately times with friends came to mind (usually involving discussions of theology or looking at current events through the lens of faith). My favorite stories generally focus on strong friendships and overcoming evil. (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GwpVwF&quot;&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2GyRIfG&quot;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/a&gt;, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also one of the core values that I’m the weakest in. When I think of who I would consider my closest friends I come up with about 10 people — we now live in about as many different states. While we can pick up the conversation right where it left off when we see each other in person, most of us are pretty bad at keeping in touch otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m hoping that by defining this as a core value on paper I will be more active in 1.) being a good friend and keeping in touch with those that I’ve known for at least half of my life and 2.) seeking out new friendships in my current location/place in life — at church, at work, maybe even centered on some of my hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Reliance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-reliance is hard wired into me. I don’t like asking for help or taking it when it’s offered, I don’t want people worrying about me and I don’t like receiving gifts. If it needs to be done, I can do it. If I don’t know how - I sure know where to go and figure it out. I get frustrated and annoyed when things don’t play out with me being able to fend for myself and/or provide for my family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end I tend to be a jack of all trades/renaissance man and have eclectic knowledge and interests. This also allows me to serve as a Swiss army knife in a variety of situations (just read any of the job descriptions I’ve ever had).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is certainly a value — but taken to the extreme it can be more of a curse. Friendship and Faith rank above it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craftsmanship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What brings me joy? Stories that keep my attention and provide a deeper meaning than what the words on the surface say. A fine whiskey. Delicious coffee. Trying out different blends of pipe tobacco. Architecture. Photography. Those things which I find to be beautiful: things that are finely crafted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also value this in my own work - I work hard to provide the best end result that I can. This blog post won’t be the most beautiful blog ever written but it is an exercise in getting the thoughts out of my head and into something tangible. I can show it off on the internet, I get feedback, I can use that to make the next one better. I can even come back and edit this one if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craftsmanship ranks 5th on the five core values because the others are higher level ideals. Craftsmanship flows from many of them and complements many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving Forward with Core Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it: my core values at this point as my life. Now that they’re formalized, I’m hoping that they will serve as a guide for what I spend my time doing, assist in making tough decisions, and giving me direction as I move forward through life. I think they also align pretty well with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mcnarymarketing.com/about&quot;&gt;McNary Marketing &amp;#x26; Design’s&lt;/a&gt; core values of: Future-thinking, clients are partners, trustworthy, organized, informed, quality — so at least I’m working at the right place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this site takes on a personal brand or ends up being a free floating personal hobby blog you can guarantee that these core values will be at the heart of it and shape the content that appears here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Evening Routine]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my last post, we journeyed through my morning routine. The morning routine gives me a solid start to the day by helping me to be alert…]]></description><link>https://jonkohlmeier.com/2017-01-24-evening-routine/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://jonkohlmeier.com/2017-01-24-evening-routine/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonkohlmeiertest.local/life/morning-routine/&quot;&gt;In my last post, we journeyed through my morning routine&lt;/a&gt;. The morning routine gives me a solid start to the day by helping me to be alert, grounded, and ready to conquer anything the day can throw at me. My evening routine is also rigid in terms of schedule - the difference is that it contains much more “margin” time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evening routine serves as a calming and reflective ritual that also allows me to do some of my best work of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Evening Routine: Weekdays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4:15 - Reflect/Clean-up at Work.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My evening routine starts with the end of the work day. I spend the last 15 minutes wrapping up anything that I’m working on, reflecting on what had been accomplished that day, and planning out the next work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4:30 - Commute Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Driving. More Podcast Listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5:00 - Workout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually in the form of 30 minutes on the stationary bike. I try to put in 10 miles in that time. I’ll also have something streaming on the TV. Recently, I’ve been on a Marvel TV show kick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5:45 - 8:00 - What’s Important?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I get a lot of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://jonkohlmeiertest.local/services/&quot;&gt;freelance web work&lt;/a&gt; in during the week. Other regular guests during this time include household chores, making/eating dinner, and spending quality time with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8:00 - Personal Goals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year my personal goals are to play a game of chess, journal, and read at least 20 pages each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chess&lt;/strong&gt; - So far this has been a game against the computer on the iPad using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tchessgame.com/pro.php&quot;&gt;tChess Pro App&lt;/a&gt;. 23 days in.. I’m not sure if I’m improving at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journal&lt;/strong&gt; - This is mostly to get me into the habit of writing again. Each entry includes the results of the chess game, what I’m reading and page number that I’m currently on, and any interesting thoughts or happenings of the day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; - Because as Tyrion Lannister says, “a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;9:00 - 10:00 - Wind down&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrap up anything left on my task list for the day and assign anything I haven’t completed to a new time slot. I try, usually unsuccessfully, to have all screens off by 9:30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10:00 - Bed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to wake up early? Go to sleep early!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your Turn!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read through my daily evening routine. Like I said above, I’m always looking for ways to tweak it to fit with my priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does your evening routine include? Is there anything that throws off your whole day, or the next day, when you miss it?

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on a daily routine kick for the last couple of years. In the last six months, I’ve kicked it into high gear. With the beginning of 2017, I’ve made some tweaks to my morning routine and evening routine. I’ve formalized them and have a “Daily Routine” task list as well as time blocked on my calendar for these routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning routine centers me and allows me to focus on what’s important without expending a lot of mental energy. It’s a stress free way to begin each day that is now mostly on autopilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Morning Routine: Monday - Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5:15 - 5:45 - Wake Up.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sleepcycle.com&quot;&gt;Sleep Cycle app&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone which, as the name suggests, measures where you are in your sleep cycle based on noise and movement. It then awakens you at the opportune moment within the window of time that you have set. The default window length is 30 minutes. So, each day, I set my Sleep Cycle alarm for 5:45 and it goes off at the best time in my sleep cycle between 5:15 and 5:45 and makes waking up less jolting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Shower&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After waking up, the first thing I do is head to the shower. That has proven to be the best thing to make me alert in the morning. I’ve tried working out first and I’m left frustrated with my poor performance. I’ve tried making coffee first and generally I’ll either spill or forget something. So shower it always is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Coffee &amp;#x26; Breakfast&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is coffee. This process begins &lt;strong&gt;by 6:15&lt;/strong&gt; at the absolute latest. Most days it’s much earlier. First cup of coffee is usually whatever bean from &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2iU7MtB&quot;&gt;Fresh Roasted Coffee, LLC&lt;/a&gt; I have on hand at the moment brewed with an AeroPress (Amazon [amazon&lt;em&gt;link asins=‘B0047BIWSK’ template=‘PriceLink’ store=‘monofmeq-20’ marketplace=‘US’ link&lt;/em&gt;id=‘43e24399-da8b-11e6-aa67-314c27541167’]). I manually grind the beans to a fine grind and usually log about 5 minutes of exercise on my Apple Watch in the process. (More on coffee and my brewing techniques in a later post.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a fresh cup of coffee in hand, it’s time to cook breakfast! Always the same thing - two eggs fried over easy or over hard depending on how I’m feeling that morning. These are seasoned with salt and pepper while cooking and topped with some hot sauce. (Recently its been &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2jjbtwj&quot;&gt;either habanero or datil pepper sauce&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-egg consumption, I sit down and take a look at personal email on the iPad. Most of this I move through these fairly quickly. Articles that I want to read later are saved into &lt;a href=&quot;https://getpocket.com&quot;&gt;Pocket&lt;/a&gt;, I unsubscribe from emails I no longer wish to receive, and create tasks for anything that needs attention. The exception to this process is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theskimm.com&quot;&gt;The Skimm&lt;/a&gt;, which I read to quickly catch up on the biggest news items of the day. (Generally, I don’t pay a lot of attention to the news but this keeps me up to date on many of the topics that might come up in conversation that day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What’s Important?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the time available I will spend it reading articles saved to pocket, checking any interactions on social media, reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2jJtC2S&quot;&gt;my current book&lt;/a&gt;, or working on a side hustle or hobby project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7:15 - More Coffee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 7:15 it’s time to brew some more coffee! This time in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2ix1DpB&quot;&gt;Chemex&lt;/a&gt; because it’s easier to fill up &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/2jJzklt&quot;&gt;my travel mug&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7:30 - Commute&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out the door at 7:30 and on my way to work. On the car radio is which ever current podcast episode I’m on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7:45 - Arrive at Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open the office and make sure that server backups completed successfully and monitor everything else on our network to make sure that there are no problems that happened overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that I’ll check email and calendar and make any necessary changes to the planning of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8:15 - Devotions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally we start our day with staff devotions in the office when everyone arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s my weekday morning routine. It gives me a grounded center to a day where I may not know what else will go on. I’m continually tweaking the morning routine with my change in priorities. This is what currently signals the beginning of my day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jonkohlmeiertest.local/life/evening-routine/&quot;&gt;In the next post, I walk through my evening routine. Read it here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your Turn!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read through my daily routine. Like I said above, I’m always looking for ways to tweak it to fit with my priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does your morning routine include? Is there anything that throws off your whole day when you miss it? Let me know in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
