Tim Ferriss puts out a weekly email called [5-Bullet Friday](https://go.tim.blog/5-bullet-friday/) where he discusses the five things he's “been loving, using, and reading.”

Honestly, I don't find his picks overly helpful or interesting—so I unsubscribed. But I liked the idea of keeping track of things that caught my eye throughout the week.

Here are some things that I watched, read, listened to, or otherwise enjoyed this week that I noticed enough to jot down.

## Watching

### Netflix's _The Punisher_ (Season 2)

Overall, a really well-done season. I also just learned that Netflix doesn't have an intuitive way to share a link directly to their content, so you'll have to search it.

## Reading

### _Parables of Judgment_ — Robert Farrar Capon

[Stan Lemon](https://stanlemon.net) sent me this book and I'm finally finishing the third book in the volume on the parables of judgment. I've really been enjoying his treatment of the parables.

## Listening

### _Life with a Twist of Lemon_

This week we had an episode on the Super Bowl, Weezer, and National Pizza Day. If you haven't listened to the podcast, you should!

## Consuming

### Roasters Coffee House — Ethiopian Yirgacheffe

If you're in the Cedar Rapids area, stop by Roasters to stock up on beans or to sit and enjoy a cup!

### Big Grove Brew Pub

Stopped by to have lunch with friends here today. Their Duck and Cover brew was delightful.

### Drink: Traditional Pink Gin

- 2 oz gin (I use Beefeater)
- 3–5 dashes Angostura bitters
- Optional garnish: lemon twist

Combine gin and bitters, stir in ice, strain into the glass of your choice.
