          title="A technologist who treats RevOps like hospitality"

          <p>
            Today I serve as Director of Web Development at McNary Marketing & Design while partnering with
            operators as a fractional RevOps lead. I map go-to-market systems, steward product migrations,
            and design enablement rituals that stick.
          </p>
          <p>
            My toolkit spans HubSpot and Salesforce, Astro and React, customer research, and the art of
            getting leaders in the same room to make a decision. I still take pride in polishing the edges—
            whether that’s accessibility, dashboard semantics, or the quality of a meeting agenda.
          </p>

            When the laptop closes, you’ll find me roasting coffee, sampling new pipe blends, podcasting on
            <a class="link-underline" href="https://twistoflemonpod.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Life with a Twist of Lemon</a>, or reading theology and leadership histories. Cedar Rapids is home base for my family and the workshop where most experiments begin.
