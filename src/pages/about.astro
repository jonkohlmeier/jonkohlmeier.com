      <p class="about-body">
        I am Jon Kohlmeier, RevOps Lead at West Music, where I help bring marketing, sales, and service teams
        together around clear and connected systems that make work feel more human.
      </p>
      <p class="about-body">
        I started my career in IT and fell in love with web development. Over time I worked across marketing, nonprofit,
        and agency web projects before finding my home in RevOps. Through it all, one thread has stayed the same. Make
        complex systems simple and help good people succeed.

        My good friend Stan Lemon once told his son, “Jon makes people successful.” That is what I try to do every day.

      <p class="about-body">
        In 2025 I served on the HubSpot Customer Advisory Board, collaborating with product leaders and operators to
        help shape how teams use HubSpot. I am also part of Lighthouse, HubSpot’s customer advocacy community, focused
        on sharing insight, craftsmanship, and what it means to grow with care instead of chaos.

      </h2>
      <p class="about-body">
        At my core, I am a listener and a communicator. Whether I am helping an engineer and a salesperson finally
        understand each other, or sitting down as a Reconciler for the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod to help people
        talk through conflict, I have learned that good systems and good relationships both start the same way. With
        clarity, respect, and a real effort to understand.

      <p class="about-body">
        Puffs of Smoke is my study. It is where I step back from the dashboards and reflect on craftsmanship,
        technology, and the human side of work. It is where I think out loud about what makes systems trustworthy,
        communication meaningful, and craft worth protecting.

        </h2>
        <p class="about-body">
          When I am not building systems, I am usually fermenting wine, recording an episode of Life with a Twist of
          Lemon, or spending time with my wife and daughter in Cedar Rapids. A good evening usually ends with
          conversation, a little pipe smoke, and the satisfaction of having helped someone do their work just a little
          bit better.
