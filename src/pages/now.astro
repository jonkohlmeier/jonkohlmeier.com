          <h3>Work & RevOps</h3>
          <p>
            I’m focused on crafting a more delightful customer experience, refining email templates, refreshing web
            pages, and improving response times so real people get real help faster. I’m deep in data cleanup and
            process simplification, working to make systems fade into the background so front-line associates can focus
            on what matters most: serving customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m always knee-deep in HubSpot betas, talking with product teams, and rebuilding lead flows from top of
            funnel to close. Most of my energy is going toward connecting people, simplifying language, and keeping
            marketing focused on emotional connection over feature lists. Leadership, I’ve decided, is something you
            practice, not something you pick up from a podcast.

          <h3>Writing & Experiments</h3>
          <p>
            I’m writing again to rebuild the muscle, exploring craftsmanship in RevOps and the human side of automation.
            Most of my tinkering happens here and on the podcast with Stan, Life with a Twist of Lemon, where we talk
            about technology, craftsmanship, and friendship.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also experimenting with AI-assisted coding, rebuilding this site, and playing with routines that make
            room for reflection and creative work. I’m between wine fermentations for now but enjoying a pipe and a glass
            of wine most evenings.

          <h3>Personal</h3>
          <p>
            At home, I’m soaking up the cool fall weather, walks with the dog, leaves underfoot, and plenty of time reading
            to my daughter (Blueberries for Sal is on repeat). We’ve got some family travel ahead and I’m working on staying
            consistent with morning coffee, exercise, and being more intentional with how I use time, money, and energy.
