My evening routine is also rigid in terms of schedule - the difference is that it contains much more “margin” time.</p>\n<p>The evening routine serves as a calming and reflective ritual that also allows me to do some of my best work of the day.</p>\n<h2>Evening Routine: Weekdays</h2>\n<h3>4:15 - Reflect/Clean-up at Work.</h3>\n<p>My evening routine starts with the end of the work day. I spend the last 15 minutes wrapping up anything that I’m working on, reflecting on what had been accomplished that day, and planning out the next work day.</p>\n<h3>4:30 - Commute Home</h3>\n<p>More Driving. More Podcast Listening.</p>\n<h3>5:00 - Workout</h3>\n<p>Usually in the form of 30 minutes on the stationary bike. I try to put in 10 miles in that time. I’ll also have something streaming on the TV. Recently, I’ve been on a Marvel TV show kick.</p>\n<h3>5:45 - 8:00 - What’s Important?</h3>\n<p>This is where I get a lot of my <a href=\"http://jonkohlmeiertest.local/services/\">freelance web work</a> in during the week. Other regular guests during this time include household chores, making/eating dinner, and spending quality time with my wife.</p>\n<h3>8:00 - Personal Goals</h3>\n<p>This year my personal goals are to play a game of chess, journal, and read at least 20 pages each day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chess</strong> - So far this has been a game against the computer on the iPad using the <a href=\"http://www.tchessgame.com/pro.php\">tChess Pro App</a>. 23 days in.. I’m not sure if I’m improving at all</li>\n<li><strong>Journal</strong> - This is mostly to get me into the habit of writing again. Each entry includes the results of the chess game, what I’m reading and page number that I’m currently on, and any interesting thoughts or happenings of the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Read</strong> - Because as Tyrion Lannister says, “a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone if it is to keep its edge.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9:00 - 10:00 - Wind down</h3>\n<p>I wrap up anything left on my task list for the day and assign anything I haven’t completed to a new time slot. I try, usually unsuccessfully, to have all screens off by 9:30.</p>\n<h3>10:00 - Bed</h3>\n<p>The best way to wake up early? Go to sleep early!</p>\n<h3>Your Turn!</h3>\n<p>Thanks for taking the time to read through my daily evening routine. Like I said above, I’m always looking for ways to tweak it to fit with my priorities.</p>\n<p>What does your evening routine include? Is there anything that throws off your whole day, or the next day, when you miss it? Let me know in the comments!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Evening Routine","date":"January 24, 2017","description":null,"headerImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":3.3333333333333335,"src":"/static/44ba3beaad28df321ed82fa4e7c2aa84/42364/evening-routine.jpg","srcSet":"/static/44ba3beaad28df321ed82fa4e7c2aa84/89f4f/evening-routine.jpg 350w,\n/static/44ba3beaad28df321ed82fa4e7c2aa84/9a128/evening-routine.jpg 700w,\n/static/44ba3beaad28df321ed82fa4e7c2aa84/42364/evening-routine.jpg 1100w","sizes":"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px"}}}}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017-01-14-morning-routine/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Morning Routine"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018-03-28-core-values/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What Gets Priority?
